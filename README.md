## Description📝
Hi, my name is Anatoly. This is my first repository, where I am practicing my Markdown skills.
## My favourite university subjects📚
My current favorite subjects are:
1. Fundamentals of AI and IAD
2. Analytical Geometry
3. Mathematical analysis
## Online VS Offline Studying🌐
| Online Studying        | Offline Studying        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Learn from anywhere               | Direct face-to-face interaction  |
| Flexible schedule                 | Structured and disciplined environment |
## My Favorite Mathematical Formulas🔢

1. **Quadratic Formula** – finds the roots of a quadratic equation:

$$
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4\alpha c}}{2\alpha}
$$

2. **Volume of a Spherical Cap** – volume of part of a sphere with height \(h\) and radius \(R\):

$$
V = \frac{\pi h^2 (3R - h)}{3}
$$

3. **Quadratic Function** – general form of a quadratic function:

$$
y = \alpha x^2 + \beta x + \gamma
$$
## My coding skills💻
I'm skilled enough to do some coding - here is one of the examples:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl; 
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It prints "Hello, world!" to the console and then ends the program successfully.  

You can try running it in an online C++ compiler like [CPP Shell](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler).
